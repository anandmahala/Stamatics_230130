# Zomato Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview
This mini-assignment focuses on cleaning and analyzing the Zomato dataset using Python tools like pandas and matplotlib.  
The goal was to prepare the data, explore it, and generate some insights about different cuisines based on ratings, votes, and cost.

## What I did
- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure
- Dealt with missing values by filling or replacing with appropriate values
- Removed duplicate records
- Cleaned and standardized important columns, including ratings, price, and cuisine
- Grouped data by cuisine to compute averages and totals (e.g. average rating, total votes)
- Created visualizations to show top cuisines by rating and popularity

## Files included
- `zomato_analysis.ipynb` → The Google Colab notebook with all the code and steps
- `cleaned_zomato.csv` → Final cleaned version of the dataset
- `cuisine_summary.csv` → Summary file with grouped stats for cuisines
- `README.md` → This file with a summary of the work

## Insights
The analysis highlighted:
- Which cuisines have the highest ratings on average
- The cuisines that are most popular based on votes
- How cost varies across different types of cuisines

## Tools used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- GitHub
